# **Data Structures and Algorithms**

This repository aims to share my studies of algorithms and data structure, from theories to implementations.
![Data Structures](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rjxO02ux--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_420,q_auto,w_1000/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w4qxi1gsnhuey77654qj.png)

The themes that I will study and share are: 
1. Fundamental Data Structures 
2. Algorithm Analysis
3. Recursion
4. Stacks, Queues and Deques
5. Trees
6. Priority Queues
7. Maps, Hash Tables and Skip Lists
8. Search Trees 
9. Sorting and Selection
10. Graph Algorthms

Like base, I will use some books, like: Data Structures and Algorithms in Java from Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia and Michael H. Goldwasser and Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People.
